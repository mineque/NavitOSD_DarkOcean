To use this OSD and / or layout, just clone the code into your navit folder and add these 2 lines in your navit.xml (right before your other OSD declaration is fine) :
```xml
<xi:include href="$NAVIT_SHAREDIR/NavitOSD_Mineque_DarkOcean/Mineque_DarkOcean.xml" xpointer="xpointer(/xiroot)"/>

```

This OSD currently looks like this :
