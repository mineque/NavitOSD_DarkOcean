mineque-osd-darkblue.xml
================

To use this OSD and / or layout, just clone the code into your .navit folder and add these 2 lines in your navit.xml (right before your other OSD declaration is fine) :
```xml
<xi:include href="${HOME}/.navit/navit-osd-darkblue/mineque-osd-darkblue.xml"/>

```

This OSD currently looks like this :

![navit-nuc-darkblue](https://github.com/mineque/navit-osd-darkblue/raw/master/screenshot.png)
