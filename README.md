Mineque_DarkOcean.xml
=====================

To use this OSD and / or layout, just clone the code into your navit folder and add these 2 lines in your navit.xml (right before your other OSD declaration is fine) :
```xml
<xi:include href="$NAVIT_SHAREDIR/NavitOSD_Mineque_DarkOcean/Mineque_DarkOcean.xml"/>

```

This OSD currently looks like this :

![NavitOSD_DarkOcean](https://github.com/mineque/NavitOSD_DarkOcean/raw/master/screenshot.png)
